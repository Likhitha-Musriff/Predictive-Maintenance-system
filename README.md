# Predictive-Maintenance-system
This project implements a predictive maintenance system to forecast equipment failures using machine learning. The goal is to analyze sensor data, preprocess it, and build a model that predicts when maintenance is needed, reducing downtime and operational costs.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Model deployment for real-time predictions (optional)
  
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
